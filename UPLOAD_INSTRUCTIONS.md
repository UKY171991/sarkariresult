Upload these files/folders to your server:
```
/public_html/ (or your domain root)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
â”œâ”€â”€ admin/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login.php
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.php

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sarkariresult.db
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ .htaccess
â””â”€â”€ diagnostic.php
```

### Step 3: Set Permissions
Via SSH or cPanel File Manager:
```bash
chmod 755 admin/
chmod 755 database/
chmod 755 includes/
chmod 666 database/sarkariresult.db
chmod 644 .htaccess
chmod 644 admin/.htaccess
```

### Step 4: Test URLs

- Diagnostic: https://job.codeapka.com/diagnostic.php
- Admin: https://job.codeapka.com/admin

### Step 5: Common Issues & Solutions
