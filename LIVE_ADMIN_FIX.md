## 📋 **Upload Checklist - Do This Now!**

### **Step 1: Upload Diagnostic File First**
1. Upload `live-diagnostic.php` to your server root
2. Visit: **https://job.codeapka.com/live-diagnostic.php**
3. This will show you exactly what's missing

### **Step 2: Upload Missing Files**
Based on what the diagnostic shows, upload these files:

```
📁 Server Root (public_html/ or your domain folder)
├── 🔴 REQUIRED: admin/
│   ├── index.php          ← Admin entry point
│   ├── login.php          ← Admin login form  
│   ├── config.php         ← Admin configuration
│   ├── dashboard.php      ← Admin dashboard
│   └── .htaccess         ← URL routing rules
├── 🔴 REQUIRED: .htaccess  ← Main URL routing
├── 🔴 REQUIRED: includes/
│   ├── config.php        ← Site configuration
│   └── environment.php   ← Auto domain detection
├── 🔴 REQUIRED: database/
│   └── sarkariresult.db  ← SQLite database with admin user
├── index.php             ← Main site
├── live-diagnostic.php   ← Diagnostic tool
└── admin-access.php      ← Emergency admin access
```

### **Step 3: Emergency Admin Access**
If `/admin` still doesn't work after upload, use these backup URLs:

- **Direct Login:** https://job.codeapka.com/admin/login.php
- **Emergency Access:** https://job.codeapka.com/admin-access.php
- **Admin Index:** https://job.codeapka.com/admin/index.php

### **Step 4: Admin Credentials**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

### **Step 5: Common Issues & Solutions**

**🔴 If admin folder is missing:**
- Upload the entire `admin/` folder from your local project

**🔴 If .htaccess is missing:**
- Upload both `.htaccess` (root) and `admin/.htaccess`

**🔴 If still getting 404:**
- Use direct login: `https://job.codeapka.com/admin/login.php`
- Contact hosting provider about mod_rewrite support

**🔴 If database errors:**
- Upload `database/sarkariresult.db` with proper permissions
- Run `https://job.codeapka.com/auto-setup.php` if available

### **Step 6: File Permissions (if using SSH/cPanel)**
```bash
chmod 755 admin/
chmod 755 database/
chmod 644 .htaccess
chmod 644 admin/.htaccess
chmod 666 database/sarkariresult.db
```

### **Quick Test:**
1. Upload `live-diagnostic.php`
2. Visit: https://job.codeapka.com/live-diagnostic.php
3. Follow the recommendations shown
4. Test admin URLs listed in the diagnostic

---

## 🎯 **Most Likely Issue:**
The admin folder and related files haven't been uploaded to the live server yet. The 404 error will disappear once all files are properly uploaded.

**Next:** Upload the diagnostic file and check what's missing!
